So, apparently, the cool new things for terminal screencasts are
[Shelr.tv](http://shelr.tv/) and [ASCII.IO](http://ascii.io/).

Since I'm the type of person that likes to edit my screencasts to death,
I'm going to be working with Shelr.tv, which saves the recorded
screencasts in a semi-editable format (undocumented, but grokable).

Let's see if embedding this actually works.
