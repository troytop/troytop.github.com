One of my solemn duties at ActiveState is digging through the morning
comment spam looking for legitimate items. [Mollom](http://mollom.com/)
used to take care of this for us, but it's catch rate seems to be
slipping. Here's today's fan mail:

>  Hi there! This post couldn't be written any better! Looking at this
>  article reminds me of my previous roommate! He always kept preaching
>  about this. I will forward this information to him. Pretty sure he
>  will have a great read. I appreciate you for sharing!

I've started to enjoy this task, actually. It's a nice little ego boost
to help start the day. I wonder if the declining catch rate for this
type of comment spam comes from soft hearted bloggers not having the
heart to report such kind words to the Mollom filters.
