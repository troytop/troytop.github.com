I've been a bad, bad blogger. Shame!

I have had *ideas* for blogs, but no time to do them. Here's a short
list for posterity and future development:

* Federated PaaS (for the People): Giving people the option to move away
  from SaaS to federated, open source mini web apps hosted on a swarm of
  peers.
* Designing New Economic Models with Social Gaming 
* Internal Contracting/Tendering Software: Big companies need a system
  for encouraging in-sourcing across departments and divisions. Things
  get contracted out when there are spare cycles in other parts of the
  organization.
* Siri in the Cloud: An AI agent for managing my online
  assets/data/presence.
* Some post about continuous deployment.
  
Hopefully, putting these ideas up in public without any supporting
information will bug me, and I'll knock them off one by one. Consider
this my personal [halfbakery](http://www.halfbakery.com/).
